Assignment 4
THE REPOSITORY CONTAINS A SINGLE PYTHON NOTEBOOK THAT HAS ALL THE CODE AND SERVES AS A REPORT AS WELL. THE HYPOTHESIS IS STATED IN THE FILE AND THE PLOTS, THE INFERENCES AND RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN THE MARKDOWN DESCRIPTION WITHIN THE NOTEBOOK.
THE PROBLEM STATEMENT PDF IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE REPOSITORY

Note: Apologies for teh late submission. I hope this doesn't attract a huge penalty. The code was entirely hand written with no LLM assistance.
